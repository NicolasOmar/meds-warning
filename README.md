## Roadmap
At this moment, I am organizing the main features into several stories that will give shape to at least 3 main versions.

Aside from thinking about objectives, I have the following first steps.
- I already created the main scaffolding using NextJS with TypeScript and am deploying the starter pack to Vercel (the link will be available in the near future).
- My next step will be to look for the toolset to be used in my day-to-day (I will create an issue for that also) and implement it.
- From that point, I will be integrating some third-party services for code quality control and dependency health (among other services to be used).

Will keep you posted on any updates, which will be forthcoming shortly.
